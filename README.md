## Building from source
### Building the executable
- Ambrosial runs on .NET Framework 4.7.2, you will need to install the SDK for it before proceeding. Visual Studio 2022/2019 can be used for building Ambrosial.
- Once opened in Visual Studio, you will need to install multiple NuGET packages using the manager. The list of required packages are as listed:

  - [x] DiscordRichPresence
  - [x] Costura.Fody
  - [x] Newtonsoft.JSON
  - [x] Guna.UI2.WinForms
- Use the Build Solution option in Visual Studio to compile the executable. It is advised to compile on Release mode.

### Creating client collection for serialization/deserialization
- The developer form has tools to obtain the current encrypted collection string, decrypt string to obtain the raw JSON and encrypt string to encrypt raw JSON. If you know what you are doing, it is simple to edit the collection string. If you wish to change the web endpoint which it collects the string from, look at the `requestEnd` string property in `setupClients()` located inside the `.\Ambrosial\AmbrosialC.cs` file.
